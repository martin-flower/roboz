# roboz performance test

The idea here is to have some simple performance tests to benchmark the roboz service. 
However, given that the executions are so slow, this is currently not a meaningful exercise - as described in the parent [README.md](../README.md)

## useful commands

* k6.io/docs
* brew install k6
* k6 version
* k6 run roboz.js
